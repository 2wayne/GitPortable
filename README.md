# Git Portable

Git Portable is a portable version of [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git/git).

Git Portable is the Git version control system packaged with a PortableApps.com launcher as a [portable app](http://portableapps.com/about/what_is_a_portable_app), so you can use Git on your iPod, USB flash drive, portable hard drive, etc. It has all the same features as Git, plus, it leaves no personal information behind on the machine you run it on, so you can take it with you wherever you go.
